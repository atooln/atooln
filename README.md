Hey there!

I am Atul Nair, a Mathematics and Computer Science graduate from UC San Diego. I am passionate about solving interesting problems with data-driven solutions. 

I recently wrote a paper with some of my colleagues on  Electromyography (EMG) Signal Classification using data science machine learning. Check out our paper here (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14947)

When I am not cleaning data or resolving overfitting issues, I enjoy lifting, BJJ, and the occasional game of chess :)

## What I'm doing: 

### ⚠️ Projects (Work in Progress) ⚠️
  - [VGG Cat/Dog Classifier](https://github.com/atooln/VGG-Cat-Dog-Classifier) : A Dog and Cat classifier which uses transfer learning and VGG Deep learning model

### Completed Projects
  - [Bank Customer Churning Analysis](https://github.com/atooln/Bank-Churning) : Analysis on the demographic of bank customers who are more likely to churn 
  - [Cat and Dog Classifier](https://github.com/atooln/Cat_n_Dog_Classifier) : Basic hand-built CNN classifier that classifies whether an image is a dog or a cat
